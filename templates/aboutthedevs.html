            <li><strong>Computer Science Background</strong>: "As I advanced through my education, I found myself
                fascinated
                with computer science and mathematics. I enjoyed the abstract process of solving problems and situations
                that computer science offered through mediums of mathematics and programming. Additionally, I am part of
                the
                very few that considers math not only fun but exciting to solve these abstract problems. These are a few
                of
                the reasons as to why I chose this degree."
            </li>
            <li><strong>Career aspirations/goals</strong>: "Going forward I will continue working towards completing
                Masterâ€™s Degree, implement AI & machine learning concepts in esports programs/software. Once I am
                proficient
                enough with the required software and concepts, I will apply them to the medical field and their API's
                and
                EMR's. Main company that I want to work at is EPIC (Healthcare company not gaming company) or RIOT
                Games."

                process
                along the way. This project was definately helpful in learning a new framework (Python Flask) and
